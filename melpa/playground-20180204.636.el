;;; Commentary:

;; Playground is a playground for Emacs. Its basic idea is to create
;; an isolated directory called a sandbox and make it $HOME of Emacs.
;; Playground allows you to easily experiment with various Emacs configuration
;; repositories available on GitHub, while keeping your current configuration
;; untouched (almost, except for a stuff for Playground). It can also simplify
;; your workflow in Emacs by hiding irrelevant files and directories
;; existing in your home directory.
