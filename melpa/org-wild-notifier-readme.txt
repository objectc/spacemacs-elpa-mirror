This package provides notification functions for org-agenda.
Notification times can be customized either globally (for all org
entries) through `org-wild-notifier-alert-time' variable or on per
org entry basis using `WILD_NOTIFIER_NOTIFY_BEFORE` property, which
in turn is customizable via
`org-wild-notifier-alert-times-property' variable.
