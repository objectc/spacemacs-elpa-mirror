;;; org-super-agenda.el --- Supercharge your agenda  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Package-Version: 20170729.1135
;; Version: 0.1-pre
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "25.1") (s "1.10.0") (dash "2.13") (org "9.0"))
;; Keywords: hypermedia, outlines, Org, agenda

;;; Commentary:

;; This package lets you "supercharge" your Org daily/weekly agenda.
;; The idea is to group items into sections, rather than having them
;; all in one big list.

;; Now you can sort-of do this already with custom agenda commands,
;; but when you do that, you lose the daily/weekly aspect of the
;; agenda: items are no longer shown based on deadline/scheduled
;; timestamps, but are shown no-matter-what.

;; So this `org-super-agenda' command essentially copies the
;; `org-agenda-list' command, but right before it inserts the agenda
;; items, it runs them through a set of filters that separate them
;; into groups.  Then the groups are inserted into the agenda buffer,
;; and any remaining items are inserted at the end.  Empty groups are
;; not displayed.

;; The end result is your standard daily/weekly agenda, but arranged
;; into groups defined by you.  You might put items with certain tags
;; in one group, habits in another group, items with certain todo
;; keywords in another, and items with certain priorities in another.
;; The possibilities are only limited by the grouping functions.

;; The `org-super-agenda' command works as a custom agenda command, so
;; you can add it to your `org-agenda-custom-commands' list.  You can
;; also test it quickly like this:

;; (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
;;        '(;; Each group has an implicit boolean OR operator between its selectors.
;;          (:name "Today" ; Optionally specify section name
;;                 :time t ; Items that have a time associated
;;                 :todo "TODAY") ; Items that have this TODO keyword
;;          (:name "Important"
;;                 ;; Single arguments given alone
;;                 :tag "bills"
;;                 :priority "A")
;;          ;; Set order of multiple groups at once
;;          (:order-multi (2 (:name "Shopping in town"
;;                                  ;; Boolean AND group matches items that match all subgroups

;;                           (:name "Food-related"
;;                                  ;; Multiple args given in list with implicit OR
;;                                  :tag ("food" "dinner"))
;;                           (:name "Personal"
;;                                  :habit t

;;                           (:name "Space-related (non-moon-or-planet-related)"
;;                                  ;; Regexps match case-insensitively on the entire entry
;;                                  :and (:regexp ("space" "NASA")

;;                                                :not (:regexp "moon" :tag "planet")))))
;;          ;; Groups supply their own section names when none are given
;;          (:todo "WAITING" :order 8) ; Set order of this section
;;          (:todo ("SOMEDAY" "TO-READ" "CHECK" "TO-WATCH" "WATCHING")
;;                 ;; Show this group at the end of the agenda (since it has the
;;                 ;; highest number). If you specified this group last, items
;;                 ;; with these todo keywords that e.g. have priority A would be
;;                 ;; displayed in that group instead, because items are grouped
;;                 ;; out in the order the groups are listed.
;;                 :order 9)
;;          (:priority<= "B"
;;                       ;; Show this section after "Today" and "Important", because

;;                       ;; are displayed lowest-number-first.
;;                       :order 1)
