This package provides a way to run multiple syntax checkers on Python code,
in parallel.  The list of supported checkers includes:

- pylint
- flake8
- pep8
- pyflakes
- mypy (for both Python 2 and 3)

This is an alternative way of running multiple Python syntax checkers in
flycheck that doesn't depend on flycheck's chaining mechanism.

flycheck is opinionated about what checkers should be run (see
https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/185), and chaining is difficult
to get right (e.g. see https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/836).
This package assumes that the user knows what they want, and can configure
their checkers accordingly -- if they want to run both flake8 and pylint,
that's fine.

This also allows us to run multiple syntax checkers in parallel, rather than
sequentially.

Usage:

Installation via MELPA is easiest:

    M-x install-package flycheck-pycheckers

In your `init.el':

(require 'flycheck-pycheckers) ; Not necessary if installed via MELPA
(with-eval-after-load 'flycheck
  (add-hook 'flycheck-mode-hook #'flycheck-pycheckers-setup))

`flycheck-pycheckers' attempts to make itself the preferred Flycheck checker
for python by adding itself to the beginning of `flycheck-checkers', which
is traversed in order until a valid checker is found.  The error list
(viewable with `flycheck-list-errors', bound to `C-c ! l' by default) shows
a unified view of all errors found by all checkers, with line and column
information where available.
