This package provides a way to run multiple syntax checkers on Python code,
in parallel.  The list of supported checkers includes:

- pylint
- flake8
- pep8
- pyflakes
- mypy (for both Python 2 and 3)

This is an alternative way of running multiple Python syntax checkers in
flycheck that doesn't depend on flycheck's chaining mechanism.

flycheck is opinionated about what checkers should be run (see
https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/185), and chaining is difficult
to get right (e.g. see https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/836).
This package assumes that the user knows what they want, and can configure
their checkers accordingly -- if they want to run both flake8 and pylint,
that's fine.

This also allows us to run multiple syntax checkers in parallel, rather than
sequentially.

Usage:

Installation via MELPA is easiest:

    M-x install-package flycheck-pycheckers

In your `init.el':

(require 'flycheck-pycheckers) ; Not necessary if installed via MELPA
(with-eval-after-load 'flycheck
  (add-hook 'flycheck-mode-hook #'flycheck-pycheckers-setup))

`flycheck-pycheckers' attempts to make itself the preferred Flycheck checker
for python by adding itself to the beginning of `flycheck-checkers', which
is traversed in order until a valid checker is found.  The error list
(viewable with `flycheck-list-errors', bound to `C-c ! l' by default) shows
a unified view of all errors found by all checkers, with line and column
information where available.

Configuration:

There are a number of options that can be customized via
`customize-variable', which all start with `flycheck-pycheckers-`.  These
include:

* `flycheck-pycheckers-args' - general arguments to pass to `pycheckers.py'.

* `flycheck-pycheckers-checkers' - the set of checkers to run (pylint, pep8,
   mypy, etc.).

* `flycheck-pycheckers-ignore-codes' - a set of error codes to universally
  ignore.  These can be set more granularly (e.g. per-project) using the
  `.pycheckers' file described below.

* `flycheck-pycheckers-max-line-length' - the default maximum line
  length.  Can be overridden via `.pycheckers' file.

* `flycheck-pycheckers-multi-thread' - whether to run each checker
  simultaneously in its own thread, for performance.

* `flycheck-pycheckers-venv-root' - a directory containing Python virtual
  environments, so that imports may be found.

Additionally, a `.pycheckers' file may be created in a directory to control
options for every file under this directory.  These files may be logically
combined, so a project may have one set of options that may be selectively
overridden in a specific subdirectory.


Example .pycheckers file:

    [DEFAULT]
    max_line_length = 120
    mypy_config_file = ci/mypy.ini
