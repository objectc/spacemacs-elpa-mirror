 This package is for people who use Anki as SRS but would like to
 create cards in Org-mode.  It does so by using Org-mode's built-in
 HTML backend to generate HTML with specific syntax (e.g. latex)
 translated to the Anki style, then sends requests to anki-connect
 (an Anki addon that runs an HTTP server to expose Anki functions
 as APIs).
