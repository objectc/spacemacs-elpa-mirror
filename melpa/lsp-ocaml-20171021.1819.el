;; OCaml support for lsp-mode using freebroccolo's
;; ocaml-language-server (https://github.com/freebroccolo/ocaml-language-server).

;;; Code:

(require 'lsp-mode)

(defun lsp-ocaml--get-root ()
  "Retrieves the root directory of the OCaml project root if available.
The current directory is assumed to be the OCaml projectâ€™s root otherwise."
  (cond
   ((and (bound-and-true-p 'projectile-mode) (projectile-project-p)) (projectile-project-root))
   ((vc-backend default-directory) (expand-file-name (vc-root-dir)))
   (t (let ((project-types '("opam" ".merlin" "package.json")))
	      (or (seq-some (lambda (file) (locate-dominating-file default-directory file)) project-types)
	          default-directory)))))

(lsp-define-stdio-client lsp-ocaml "ocaml" #'lsp-ocaml--get-root
			 '("ocaml-language-server" "--stdio"))
