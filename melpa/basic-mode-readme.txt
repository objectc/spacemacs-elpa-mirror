This package provides a major mode for editing BASIC code. This
includes syntax highlighting and indentation.

Installation:

Install basic-mode from MELPA at https://melpa.org

Configuration:

You can customize the indentation of code blocks, see variable
`basic-indent-offset'. The default value is 4. You can also
customize the number of columns to use for line numbers, see
variable `basic-line-number-cols'. The default value is 0, which
means not using line numbers at all.
