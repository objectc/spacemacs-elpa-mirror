This library implements a Markdown back-end compatible with the
Hugo static site generator (https://gohugo.io/) for Org exporter.
This includes the generation of the Hugo post front-matter in TOML
or YAML.

See the README and Wiki on https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo
for examples and instructions.
